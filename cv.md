## Summary
I've always stood out by being passionate and going whole-heartedly in what I did and what I learned. 
In my early student years, I started learning iOS development using online materials and courses. Half a year after I joined team at **[Datasite Technologies](http://datasite.uz)** as an intern and a very very junior developer. 
I could work my way up and build trust among my peers and the management so that they had confidence to assign me to other projects.
I left the company as a bird leaves its nest once its wings are strong enough. 
I joined a team at [tickit.co](https://facebook.com/tickitco/) where I and a team of 4 set out to build the first ever online ticket-selling app in Uzbekistan - ***Tickit***.
My passion for building outstanding user experiences helped me carve a niche for the app on Apple's App Store and land on #7 in Uzbekistan's Entertainment.
Early in 2018, friends and I started a company to build America's best Transportation Management System using latest web technologies and here I am, joining RS-School to expand my network of contacts and upgrade my JS skills to the next level.

## Skills.
* Interpersonal skills:
  I am :100: in interpersonal skills; I can find a common ground with anyone and a great team player. I deeply believe that with a great team and an absolute vision, one can achieve anything.
* Intrapersonal skills: I am deeply motivated and always go for what my heart truly believes in.

* Technical skills:
  * **Terminal** (Command-Line);
  * **Angular**: Typescript, HTML, SCSS, PWA, VS Code;
  * **iOS development**: Swift 4, MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, Xcode 10;
  * **Git**: Conventional commits, Git Flow;
  * **Design eye**: I have a maximalist eye-for-detail - always make sure that interfaces are pixel-perfect.
